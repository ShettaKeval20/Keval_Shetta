    "BuddiesGram is a real-time social app to share and explore visual moments. Public posts connect people worldwide, just like threads on Twitter. Private chats stay secure — only friends can message each other.",
  detailedDescription:
    "BuddiesGram was built to recreate the freedom of global sharing while prioritizing user safety and meaningful connections. The goal was simple: let anyone share photos and moments publicly, discover new people, and engage through likes and comments — but protect personal space by restricting private messages to real friends only. Unlike typical social media where anyone can send unsolicited messages, BuddiesGram uses a friends-only chat system to prevent spam, threats, or harassment. Technically, it leverages Google Sign-In via OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication, Firebase Authentication for login and signup, Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync posts and messages in real time, and XML for clean UI layouts following Material Design guidelines. Many challenges were solved through trial and error, like building robust API integrations with Retrofit and optimizing backend operations to handle real-time interactions smoothly. The result? A social platform where people can truly connect — publicly and safely.",

  challenges:
    "Implementing secure Google OAuth with Firebase Auth, ensuring smooth real-time sync in Realtime Database, and optimizing UI responsiveness for different Android devices.",
  solutions:
    "Integrated Google Sign-In with OAuth 2.0, structured Realtime DB for fast reads/writes, and applied lazy loading for images and posts. Used Retrofit for scalable API handling.",
  features: [
    "Google Sign-In for secure login",
    "Public posts like Threads",
    "Friends-only chat system",
    "Like & comment functionality",
    "Firebase Realtime updates",

  ],
  whatILearned:
    "This project taught me how to implement secure OAuth authentication using Firebase, design scalable Realtime Database structures for instant updates, and optimize API interactions with Retrofit. I also learned to apply user feedback iteratively to refine UX and handle edge cases like blocking unsolicited messages.",
  keyDecisions: [
    "Chose Firebase Realtime DB instead of Firestore for faster sync and lower latency for chat.",
    "Implemented Google OAuth to eliminate password storage and boost sign-up conversion.",
    "Used Retrofit for robust network calls and future API integrations."
